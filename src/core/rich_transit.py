Proposition D‴.48 (PARADIGM.md §5d): the rich transit — from small masses the kernels enter one at a time
====================================================================================================================================

The free mass–amplitude law of Proposition D‴.45 (dα_i = Gβ_ia′_ig_i, dβ_i = γβ_ia_ig_i, w_i = β_ia_i/m, Q_i conserved) started at α = 0
with masses β⁰_i = εb_i follows, in the time τ = t/Λ(ε), Λ = (πa_max/(4G))(2/(cε))^{1/2}, the inverse scale space flow of
Σ_i|w_i|/√b_i (`mirror_free.iss_path`): the kernels enter one at a time. With the kernels' centres moving by the paradigm's law
(Proposition D‴.34's positions, Euclidean: ċ_i = Gβ_ia_i⟨r∂_cφ_i⟩ = Gmw_i⟨r∂_cφ_i⟩) an inactive kernel — coefficient O(ε^{3/2}) — does
not move, and an entered one slides: the limit is the sliding inverse scale space (`sliding_iss`): the inactive kernels' dual coordinates
integrate the residual's correlation at their starting positions, an entrant joins the active block, the block relaxes on the fast time
(on the critical curve Q = −c, an ε-independent flow) to a stationary point of the fit over its coefficients and centres. With a
Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao metric on the positions instead (the mass dropped from the centre's speed, ċ_i = Ga_i⟨r∂_cφ_i⟩) an inactive kernel's
amplitude is O(ε^{1/2}) and its centre moves at O(1) in τ — dc/dτ = (πa_max²/(4cρ))tan(πu/(2ρ))⟨r∂_cφ⟩, du/dτ = ⟨rφ⟩ (`wfr_inactive_rhs`):
the kernels climb the correlation's peaks before entering — condensation.

This module: Gaussian kernels on a sample grid (`Bumps`; on a reference orbit with the closed loop's error filter, `OrbitBumps` —
Proposition D‴.49's leading order —, and the closed loop's exact averaged drive along the frozen periodic orbit, `FrozenOrbit` with
`frozen_orbit_rhs`), the free law with moving centres under either metric (`moving_rhs`) and with moving widths too
(`moving_rhs_widths`), the active block's fast flow on the critical curve (`critical_rhs`), the sliding inverse scale space
(`sliding_iss`) and the inactive kernels' limit under the Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao metric (`wfr_inactive_rhs`). Proposition D‴.51 (the
transit at a finite mass): the critical curve's inner profile near the wall (`eta_crit`, `coef_crit`, `inner_coef`, `inner_xi`), the
entrant's overshoot (`overshoot`), the ε-free inner problem of a near tie (`near_tie_inner`), the sliding path's duals (`path_duals`), the
creep of a kernel left near its wall along the path (`creep_reaches`) and the mass below which the loop forms exactly the path's kernels,
predicted from the path alone (`recovery_threshold`).
