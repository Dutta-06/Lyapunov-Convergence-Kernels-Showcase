Proposition D‴.12: the barycentric OT leak toward a prior measure — the mass constraint against the weight fluctuation
=====================================================================================================================

The averaged slow loop of Theorem D‴ on the three-bump instance of `exp_chaos_learning.py` at σ₀ = 0.15σ_crit, with the matching prior
of `exp_prior_design.py` (three atoms at the exact representation, masses q = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) = the plant's representation weights), under
two leaks on the same clouds: the nearest-atom leak (𝔄_m^ν) of Proposition D‴.9, which conserves the cluster masses, and the barycentric
OT leak (𝔄_m^{OT}) of Theorem C′, which constrains them to q.

1. Commensurate sizes (mq ∈ ℕ³): m = 15, 60, 240 against M = 510, warm start = the jittered mixture around the exact representation,
   600 slow units. Records: the cluster weights (conserved against driven to q; the equalisation time), the mass in transit, the fit
   errors, and — against the reference — the synchronous coupled distance D, the function-level distance ‖f̂_m − f̂_M‖²_{L²(ρ)} and the exact
   W²_{G⁻¹}(μ_m, μ_M); the last-window values of the three distances under the two leaks, and the nearest-atom leak's predicted function-level
   floor (1/m − 1/M)tr(FC̃Fᵀ)/N.
2. Incommensurate sizes: m = 16, 64, 256 against M = 512 (one or two split particles): the same records, the split particles at the end
   (their plan rows and positions), and the m-laws of the stationary floors under the two leaks.
3. The masses as a design input (no dynamics): for q_δ = (1/3 + δ, 1/3 − δ/2, 1/3 − δ/2) the weighted stationary point Θ*(q_δ), its fit
   error (the bias of the mass constraint), κ_R at the atoms and over N_{ϱ′}, the margin, the splitting margin (admissibility of the
   designed masses) and the half-separation check ε < Δ_ν/2 of the diagonal plan.

Output: results/chaos/ot_leak.md and ot_leak_raw.npz (CLW_WORKERS, OTL_SEEDS, OTL_S_END to change the pool).
