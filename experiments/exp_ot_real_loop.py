"""
Corollary D‴.14: the real closed loop with the OT leak — the periodic orbit is the lift of the weighted K₀-atom loop's, the same for every
commensurate size
====================================================================================================================================

The real closed loop of Theorem J (k_e = 25, σ = σ₀/k_e, RK4 plant with the control held over the step, Euler parameters, dt = 10⁻³) on the
three-bump instance, with the nearest-atom leak and with the barycentric OT leak toward the matching prior (plan recomputed every 100 steps),
started from the contracted clouds at the end of the averaged runs of `exp_ot_leak.py` (commensurate set: m = 15, 60 and M = 510; the OT
runs' clouds have the prior's masses, the nearest-atom runs' clouds their conserved sampled weights) and from the collapsed lifts — the
three atoms of the exact representation for the OT leak (the weighted 3-atom loop with q = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)), and the replicated weighted
stationary configurations Θ*(w^m) for the nearest-atom leak. Over the last five periods: the learned function along the reference orbit
against the reference's and against the lift's, the fit error along the orbit, the rms tracking error, W²_{G⁻¹} between configurations.

Output: results/chaos/ot_real_loop.md and ot_real_loop_raw.npz (ORL_T for the horizon, ORL_SEEDS for the seeds).
