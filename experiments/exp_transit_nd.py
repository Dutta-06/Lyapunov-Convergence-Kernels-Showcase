Proposition D‴.54: the transit in ℝⁿ — one feature on a lattice of kernels (the k-fold near tie and its shares, the formation map at a
vertex) and several features in the plane
====================================================================================================================================

The free law with moving centres (Proposition D‴.48(iii); m = 12, G = 1, γ = 0.1, a_max = 1, c = 0.025), Gaussian kernels of width SIG in
the plane (`rich_transit_nd`, the samples on a tensor grid), masses ε, from α = 0.

A. The k-fold near tie. One feature of amplitude A near a tie of the kernels' square lattice of spacing H: an edge (the kernels at (0, 0)
   and (H, 0), the feature near (H/2, 0): a 2-fold tie) and a vertex ((0, 0), (H, 0), (0, H), (H, H), the feature near (H/2, H/2): a
   4-fold tie), placed so that the runner-ups' margins when the entrant enters are μ_j = ε^{1/2}x_j for the given gaps (the diagonal's
   gap then follows: x₁₁ ≈ x₁₀ + x₀₁). The loop to TAU_A τ_entry at ε = EPS_A; the shares |w_j|/Σ|w| against the ε-free inner problem
   with the k kernels at the same gaps (the feature at the tie; `inner_k`), the softmax e^{−κx_j}/Σe^{−κx_i} (κ = πρ(2c)^{1/2}) and, at
   the vertex, the product of the two edges' inner problems (the factorisation of the 4-fold split).
B. The formation map at a vertex: the number of kernels formed (|w| > TH_REL·|A|) over gaps (x₁₀, x₀₁) on a grid, the loop at EPS_B
   against the 4-kernel inner problem and the independent rule #{j: x_j < x_θ} (x_θ: the 2-fold inner problem's crossing of TH_REL);
   the probabilities for a feature placed uniformly in a Voronoi cell, P(N ≥ 2) ∝ ε^{1/2}, P(N ≥ 3) and P(N = 4) ∝ ε, from the map's areas.
C. Several features in the plane: random three-feature targets on the lattice over [−1, 1]², the sliding path against the loop at ε =
   EPS_C: the kernels formed, the never-entering kernels' largest coefficient (∝ ε^{3/2}) and displacement (∝ ε), the block against the
   path's.
T. The 2-kernel (edge) inner problem's runner-up share p(x; t) on a grid of gaps x and of the feature's offsets t along the face
   (referee round 42: the split depends on where the feature sits on the face, not only on the gap) — x_θ(t) and its average over the
   face; the product rule: at a vertex, where each edge's offset is t = H/2, the kernel e + h1_S has the share
   Π_{i∈S}p(x_i; H/2)Π_{i∉S}(1 − p(x_i; H/2)), formed when it exceeds TH_REL —, used by A, B's map and D.
B4. The 4-kernel inner problem on a finer grid of gaps (GRID_B4): the areas of the regions N ≥ 3 and N = 4 at a vertex, against the
   product rule's.
D. The probabilities: features placed uniformly in a Voronoi cell (N_D positions) at ε = EPS_D, the loop's count against the product
   rule at each position's gaps and offsets and against the asymptotic P(N ≥ 2) = (4/h)·∫w(t)dt/h, w(t) = 2σ²x_θ(t)ε^{1/2}/h.
H. A hexagonal lattice (spacing H; a Voronoi vertex meets three cells, so k ≤ n + 1 = 3): the 3-kernel inner problem at a vertex's exact
   tie, its formation region N ≥ 3 in the two runner-ups' gaps and P(N ≥ 3) ∝ ε from it, the fourth kernel's gap there, and the loop at
   the exact tie against the inner problem.
T2. x_θ(t) at the offsets T_FAR beyond H/2 (by bisection): the faces of hℤⁿ for n ≥ 3 reach |t| = (n − 1)^{1/2}H/2, and in the
   continuum the 2-kernel problem with the feature at the transverse offset t reduces to the plane of the axis and t — x_θ depends on
   |t| only —, so the face averages x̄_θ⁽ⁿ⁾ over the (n − 1)-cube of offsets give E[N − 1] on hℤⁿ.
W. Where the selection is the Voronoi cell (referee round 42): W1 the samples' window (Part C's grid: the faces between neighbours on
   the axis x₂ = 0 and the margins' error against the continuum's toward the window's edge); W2 unequal masses (the kernel at (H, 0) of
   mass βε: the entrant the kernel of the least entry time ρ_j/v_j — a power diagram —, the loop at EPS_W); W3 coarse samples along x₂
   (spacing DS_W: the face's shift against the Poisson summation's harmonics); W4 two coinciding kernels with the feature off their
   centre (the inner problem against the profile split); W5 the profile split against the softmax at the formation threshold.
C2. Designed targets in the plane: a near tie (one feature near a face of the lattice, its runner-up's margin MU_C2 at the first entry:
   the gap MU_C2/ε^{1/2} crosses x_θ between the masses EPS_C) and a feature at the window's edge (the samples' entrant is not the
   nearest kernel) — the loop against the path and the near-tie rule.
