# Corollary D‴.14 in two dimensions: the real closed loop with the OT leak on a planar plant (`exp_ot_2d.py`)

Plant ẋ = f(x) + u on ℝ², f the sum of four Gaussian bumps with vector amplitudes (A_k, C_k, S_k) = [((np.float64(0.8), np.float64(0.3)), (np.float64(-1.2), np.float64(0.8)), 0.7), ((np.float64(-0.5), np.float64(0.6)), (np.float64(1.0), np.float64(1.0)), 0.6), ((np.float64(0.4), np.float64(-0.7)), (np.float64(0.8), np.float64(-1.1)), 0.6), ((np.float64(-0.6), np.float64(-0.4)), (np.float64(-1.0), np.float64(-0.9)), 0.7)], reference x_m(t) = (2 sin t, 1.5 sin 2t), saturated network with n = 2 (a_max = 4.0, c_max = 3.0, s ∈ [0.3, 2.0]), G = diag(1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25), matching prior = the exact representation (four atoms with amplitudes 4A_k, masses q = 1/4). Real loop at k_e = 25, σ = σ₀/k_e with σ₀ = 0.05 (ln 2/σ₀ = 14 slow units), RK4 plant with the control and the reference evaluated at the stages and the parameters frozen over the step, Euler parameters, dt = 0.002, 2500 time units = 100 slow units = 5.0/σ₀ = 398 periods; warm start = the mixture of Gaussians of width 0.02 (G⁻¹ metric) around the exact representation with random class labels; the same clouds under the nearest-atom leak and under the OT leak (plan every 100 steps); sizes m = 8, 32 and M = 128; seeds 0, 1; statistics over the last 10 periods.

Equalisation of the OT leak's cluster weights (first weight record from which w = q to within half a particle, in slow units): seed 0, m = 8: 13; seed 0, m = 32: 14; seed 0, m = 128: 14; seed 1, m = 8: 13; seed 1, m = 32: 14; seed 1, m = 128: 14 (ln 2/σ₀ = 14).

Reading. In two dimensions as in one: the nearest-atom leak conserves the clouds' sampled cluster weights and the sizes learn different functions (‖f̂_m − f̂_M‖² = 5.5e-03–2.3e-02), the OT leak drives the weights to the prior's masses and the sizes agree (5.0e-08–1.6e-07); the rms tracking error is 3.9e-06–1.6e-05 under the OT leak against 1.9e-03–6.7e-03 under the nearest-atom leak.

Numbers are produced by `experiments/exp_ot_2d.py`; nothing is edited by hand.
