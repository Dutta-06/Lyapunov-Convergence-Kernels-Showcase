## C. The rich limits on one design (8 × 20; the target on atoms [1, 5, 9])

Sign-constrained basis pursuit weighted by 1/|a(0)| (the frozen signs: the target's on its atoms, random elsewhere): support [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11] (the target: no); basis pursuit: support [2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 19].

The vertices' certificates (|S| = N, ξ from Φ_Sᵀξ = ρ_S·sign): the smallest relative slacks off the support μ_j = 1 − s_j(Φᵀξ)_j/ρ_j — sign-constrained, weights 1/(γ|a(0)|): 0.1039, 0.1301, 0.1873; basis pursuit (equal weights): 0.0157, 0.0197, 0.0465.

The projection's distance to its limit against the leading order computed from the certificate (the support's mirror coordinates at the vertex, the off-support coefficients through each particle's mirror map: ≈ e^{O(1)}ε^{μ_j} on branches, a_maxε^{3/2}cos(πμ_j/2)/(m(2c)^{1/2}sin³(πμ_j/2)) from α(0) = 0 — the closed form's largest relative error off the support in the last column):

A mixed start (the even atoms at α = 0, the odd ones on branches): the free particles' total |w| and the distance to the branch atoms' own sign-constrained weighted basis pursuit:

## F. The real loop on positive branches (k_e = 5, G = γ = 1, twelve atoms of width 0.25, the target on atoms [2, 6, 9], α(0) = 0.5, β(0) = 10⁻³, 4000 time units)

V̇ against −k_ee² at 12 random states (w* vanishing on nine atoms, their terms β/(γm)): largest relative difference 1.69e-8.

By quarters: max V, the rms error, the largest mass on the unused atoms; V's largest increase between samples 0 (V(0) = 3.64); max |w − w*| at the end 0.0797:

| | quarter 1 | quarter 2 | quarter 3 | quarter 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| max V | 3.64 | 2.67 | 1.72 | 0.871 |
| rms e | 0.0139 | 0.0138 | 0.013 | 0.00898 |
