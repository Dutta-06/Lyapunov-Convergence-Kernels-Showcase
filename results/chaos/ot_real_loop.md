# Corollary D‴.14: the real closed loop with the OT leak — the orbit is the lift of the weighted K₀-atom loop's, the same for every commensurate size (`exp_ot_real_loop.py`)

The real closed loop of Theorem J on the three-bump instance (k_e = 25, σ = σ₀/k_e with σ₀ = 0.15σ_crit = 0.00707, RK4 plant with the control and the reference evaluated at the stages and the parameters frozen over the step, Euler parameters, dt = 0.001), 100 time units = 15.9 periods = 4.0 slow units; statistics over the last 5 periods on the 400-point grid of the reference orbit. Starts: the contracted clouds at the end of `exp_ot_leak.py`'s averaged runs (commensurate set, m = 15, 60, M = 510; the OT runs' clouds carry the prior's masses q = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), the nearest-atom runs' clouds their conserved sampled weights), and the collapsed lifts: the three atoms of the exact representation for the OT leak (the weighted 3-atom loop with weights q, itself the m = 3 loop), and the replicated weighted stationary configurations Θ*(w^m) for the nearest-atom leak. Seeds 0, 1; the leak target (the nearest atom, or the barycentric projection of the vertex plan) recomputed every 100 steps.

Reading. Under the OT leak the learned functions of m = 15, 60 and M = 510 agree along the orbit to ‖f̂_m − f̂_M‖² = 7.5e-09–2.7e-08 and with the 3-atom lift to 5.2e-10–3.6e-08 (the within-class spread of the clouds, second order); under the nearest-atom leak they disagree by 1.1e-04–2.5e-03. Where both realised weight vectors are admissible this disagreement is the distance between the lifted orbits of the conserved weights to a ratio of 1.0003–1.0003 (1 pairs), and each admissible m-system is within 2.5e-11 of its own lift (within-class spread 5.5e-04–1.3e-03); the 3 systems with inadmissible realised weights — seed 0, m = 15 (margin -0.00348), seed 1, m = 15 (margin -0.00108), seed 1, m = 60 (margin -0.00216) — are not on their lifts, which are saddle orbits: their over-weighted class is split (within-class spread 4.2e-02–1.1e-01), the distance to the lift 4.1e-08–3.3e-06 being the split's second-order effect on f̂, and the lift-to-lift ratio at those pairs is 0.960, 0.998, 0.961. The rms tracking error is 8.9e-07–7.3e-06 under the OT leak (the m-systems' remaining fit error over k_e; the collapsed lift tracks to 7.9e-12, the scheme's floor) against 3.2e-04–1.9e-03 under the nearest-atom leak — the weight bias of the fit is a tracking error, which the mass constraint removes for every size at once.
