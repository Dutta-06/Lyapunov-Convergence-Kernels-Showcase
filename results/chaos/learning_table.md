# Theorem D‴: uniform-in-time propagation of chaos in the learning regime — the averaged slow loop (`exp_chaos_learning.py`)

n = 1, saturated features with a_max = 4.0, c_max = 3.0, s ∈ [0.3, 2.0], prior ϑ⁰ = 0, G = diag(1.0, 0.25, 0.25); plant f(x) = Σ_k A_k e^{−(x−C_k)²/(2S_k²)} with (A, C, S) = [(1.0, -1.5, 0.5), (-0.7, 0.0, 0.4), (0.8, 1.5, 0.5)] (three bumps; the network can represent it exactly with three kernels of weights 3A_k); reference x_m = 2 sin t, ρ its occupation measure on a grid of 256 times; slow time s = t/k_e, (𝔄_m) integrated by the midpoint rule with step 0.02; the m-systems share their particles with an M = 2048 reference (the stand-in for the mean-field flow, as in Theorems D′ and D″); horizon 900 slow units.

Constants. Proposition K: the collapsed critical point (best single kernel, a = 0.331, c = -0.057, s = 1.218) is a strict local minimum of J_m iff σ₀ > σ_crit = 0.04716; the runs use σ₀ = 0.15σ_crit = 0.00707 (learning regime; the leak time 1/σ₀ = 141 slow units). Whitened Lipschitz constants by search (|x| ≤ 2.5, 6·10⁴ sampled ϑ, Nelder–Mead polish): L_ϑ^G = 4.044 (closed-form bound 4.658), L₂^G = 11.11 (closed-form bound λ_G a_max/s_min² = 44.44); K_Φ = 4.0, F_ρ = 0.999.

## 1. Hypothesis (H) at the three-atom stationary measure, and the window

σ₀ = 0.15σ_crit = 0.00707: the critical point of J₃ from the exact representation has atoms (a, c, s) = (2.4504, -1.4161, 0.8287), (-2.2879, 0.0120, 0.7009), (2.0478, 1.3427, 0.8810); sup-norm of ∇J₃ = 4.2e-17 (a stationary measure of the mean-field flow); fit error ‖f − f̂‖/‖f‖ = 0.2439; eigenvalues of G^{1/2}∇²J₃G^{1/2}: 0.0057, 0.0086, 0.0205, 0.0216, 0.0362, 0.0610, 0.0736, 0.1357, 0.2003 (a strict local minimum of J₃). κ_R at the atoms: 0.00004, -0.00227, 0.00411 (σ₀ − max = +0.00297); over the spheres of radius ϱ′ around the atoms (400 directions, radii ϱ′ and ϱ′/2): ϱ′ = 0.05: κ_R = 0.00461, margin σ₀ − κ_R = +0.00247; ϱ′ = 0.1: κ_R = 0.00512, margin σ₀ − κ_R = +0.00195; ϱ′ = 0.2: κ_R = 0.00619, margin σ₀ − κ_R = +0.00089; ϱ′ = 0.3: κ_R = 0.00730, margin σ₀ − κ_R = -0.00023.

For comparison, σ₀ = 0.3σ_crit = 0.01415: the critical point of J₃ from the exact representation has atoms (a, c, s) = (2.1082, -1.3689, 0.9251), (-2.1262, -0.0059, 0.7462), (1.7063, 1.1865, 1.0875); sup-norm of ∇J₃ = 9.7e-17 (a stationary measure of the mean-field flow); fit error ‖f − f̂‖/‖f‖ = 0.4057; eigenvalues of G^{1/2}∇²J₃G^{1/2}: 0.0032, 0.0099, 0.0274, 0.0375, 0.0498, 0.0597, 0.0753, 0.1768, 0.2241 (a strict local minimum of J₃). κ_R at the atoms: 0.00841, -0.00220, 0.01696 (σ₀ − max = -0.00282); over the spheres of radius ϱ′ around the atoms (400 directions, radii ϱ′ and ϱ′/2): ϱ′ = 0.05: κ_R = 0.01757, margin σ₀ − κ_R = -0.00342; ϱ′ = 0.1: κ_R = 0.01819, margin σ₀ − κ_R = -0.00404; ϱ′ = 0.2: κ_R = 0.01949, margin σ₀ − κ_R = -0.00534; ϱ′ = 0.3: κ_R = 0.02088, margin σ₀ − κ_R = -0.00673.

At σ₀ = 0.15σ_crit the window of Remark D‴.1 is realised: κ_R[μ*](N_0.1) = 0.00512 < σ₀ = 0.00707 < σ_crit = 0.04716: the collapsed configuration is unstable (the kernels separate) and the three-atom measure satisfies the strict second-order condition with margin κ(ϱ′ = 0.1) = 0.00195 (relaxation time 1/κ = 512 slow units). At σ₀ = 0.3σ_crit the three-atom measure fails the splitting condition at one atom (κ_R = 0.01696 > σ₀ = 0.01415): there the mean-field flow's limit has more atoms, and the hypothesis has to be checked at that configuration.

Theorem D‴'s constants for the warm start (Λ₁ = 0, s₁ = 0, κ := ½ min{κ(ϱ′), min_s a(s)} = 0.00070 with a(s) measured along the reference below): R₀ = 4.561, R_Θ = 2857.326, V_max = 40.428, ϱ = 1.064e-06, θ = 4.574e-11, Δ = 6.995e-14, C₁ = 4(L_ϑ^G)²K_Φ²/κ² = 2.163e+09, m₀ = 16K_Φ²/θ² = 1.224e+23. The bound C₁/m is uniform in time but far above the measured distances: C₁ carries the worst-case constants L_ϑ^G and K_Φ and the factor κ⁻², and the tail term needs m ≥ m₀.

## 2. The hypothesis along the reference flow

κ_R at the reference particles (max over the 2048 particles) and over the spheres of radius ϱ′ = 0.1 (G⁻¹ metric) around 256 of them (24 directions each; a lower estimate of the supremum over the neighbourhood), computed with the reference's own residual (which carries its sampling fluctuation, the term L₂^GY of (2.1)) and, for the warm start, with the residual r* of the stationary measure μ* (the proxy for the mean-field flow's residual: the hypothesis (H) is about μ_s); the margin a(s) = σ₀ − κ_R[μ*](spheres); ‖r_ref − r*‖_{L¹(ρ)}; the reference's fit error ‖f − f̂‖/‖f‖ on the orbit and its rms drift (G⁻¹ norm); means over the seeds.

Warm start: min_s a(s) = +0.00139 > 0: (H) holds along the whole run with the stationary residual (s₁ = 0, Λ₁ = 0). With the reference's own residual the sphere statistic is larger by at most 0.00013 (its sampling fluctuation; the proof's bound (0.2) allows L₂^G‖r_ref − r*‖_{L¹} ≤ 0.2140).
Cold start: min_s a(s) = -0.19609 at s = 0, final a = -0.00251: (H) fails at the end of the run (the connected support reaches the ridges, Remark D‴.2).

Slope of the last-window maximum of D_m against m (per-seed fits, mean ± s.e.): -1.28 ± 0.30 (Theorem D‴: −1 for the mean square; the function-level distance ‖f̂_Θ − f̂_ref‖ has slope -0.69 ± 0.16, m^{−1/2} being −0.5). Ratio of the last to the first window maxima: 1.13, 1.13, 1.15; last to the one before: 1.02, 1.01, 1.02 (uniform in time means no growth).

Proposition D‴.5 (the weight-sensitivity law). The sensitivity S_k = ∂ϑ*_k/∂w of the three-atom stationary point to the cluster weights (central differences of the weighted stationary point, whitened norms): ‖S_k‖ = 8.377, 4.657, 8.322. Predicted mean-square stationary distance E D_∞ = (1/m − 1/M)·Σ_k w̄_k tr(S̃_k C̃ S̃_kᵀ), measured D_m on the last window, and the per-seed prediction Σ_k w^m_k‖S̃_k(w^m − w^M)‖² from the realised cluster weights against the measured D_m at s = 900:

Per seed, the measured D_m at s = 900 is within 25% of the prediction from the realised weights in 9 of the 12 (seed, m) pairs; the largest deviation is the ratio 0.57 at m = 16, seed 3, the pair with the largest weight fluctuation |w^m − w^M| = 0.275 (the linearisation's O(|w^m − w^M|³) remainder and the saturation a ≤ a_max). The multinomial expectation E D_∞ is compared with a mean over 4 seeds, whose standard error is that of a heavy-tailed quantity (E|w^m − w^M|² is dominated by the rare large fluctuations); the per-seed comparison is the sharp test.

Reading: on the warm start near the stationary measure the hypothesis holds along the whole run (min a(s) = +0.0014); the per-particle localisation of part (c) is not in force at these m (max_i‖δ_i‖_{G⁻¹} = 1.36, 0.62, 0.21 against 3ϱ′/4 = 0.075; Remark D‴.6: the particles of a cluster are displaced together by the weight fluctuation); the window maxima of D_m do not grow (last/first 1.13, 1.13, 1.15), the m-law of the mean square has slope -1.28 (theorem: −1), and the measured values lie below the bound C₁/m (which carries no transient factor here, Λ₁ = 0). On the cold start the support threads the ridges and (H) fails along the run (min a = -0.1961); the coupled distance grows over the horizon (last/first 2.95, 3.54, 7.84), its m-law has slope -0.87, and at the end a fraction 0.203, 0.082, 0.037 (m = 16, 64, 256) of the pairs sit more than one whitened unit apart: pairs in different basins, the floor of Remark D‴.2, whose fraction decreases with m. The real loop on the warm start is consistent with the averaged system at equal slow times within the seed-to-seed spread (last-window ratios real/averaged 1.57, 0.78, 2.58 for m = 16, 64, 256, against relative standard errors of 30–60% on both sides): its growth over t ≤ 2000 (last/first 1.80, 1.50, 1.56; 80 slow units, 0.16 relaxation times) is the early transient of the averaged dynamics, which saturates by s ≈ 450 (Corollary D‴.7); Theorem D″'s cold start at the same k_e grew threefold over 1000 s and the cold start here grows and carries the floor.
