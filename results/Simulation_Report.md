# Lyapunov Convergence Simulation Results

This report aggregates the findings from the empirical validation of the Self-Adaptive Kernels architecture.

## Tier 1: Essential Validation

### Chaotic Reference Tracking (Lorenz)
- **Objective:** Demonstrate elimination of steady-state bias compared to classical σ-modification and e-modification.
- **Plot:** `results/tier1_lorenz_tracking.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** Proposed architecture converges to a tight UUB bound without the persistent bias floor seen in the baselines.

### Monte Carlo Feasibility Sweep
- **Objective:** Verify global interior descent properties via randomized initial conditions.
- **Plot:** `results/tier1_monte_carlo.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** 100% of trials satisfy the R_UUB bound criterion.

## Tier 2: Deeper Insights

### Nonlinear Benchmark (Duffing Oscillator)
- **Objective:** Stress the non-autonomous drift bounds using time-varying plant dynamics.
- **Plot:** `results/tier2_duffing.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** Controller successfully tracks despite shifting stiffness α(t).

### Parameter Migration Visualization
- **Objective:** Visualize the fully adaptive kernels moving and resizing in state space.
- **Plot:** `results/tier2_parameter_evolution.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** Kernels migrate towards trajectories while remaining bounded by Ω_c.

### Empirical vs. Theoretical R_UUB
- **Objective:** Confirm scaling laws derived in the paper.
- **Plot:** `results/tier2_ruub_sweep.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** Error scaling follows theoretical predictions with respect to k_e and Γ.

## Tier 3: Differentiating Features

### Architecture Ablation
- **Objective:** Quantify the benefit of full adaptation over fixed grids.
- **Plot:** `results/tier3_ablation.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** Full adaptation achieves significantly lower error for a fixed number of kernels.

### Robustness Stress Test
- **Objective:** Show graceful degradation under extreme unmodeled dynamics.
- **Plot:** `results/tier3_robustness.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** Error increases but remains bounded; hard parameter bounds are strictly enforced despite extreme disturbance.

### Computational Overhead
- **Objective:** Prove feasibility for real-time control.
- **Plot:** `results/tier3_computational.png`
- **Expected Outcome:** Projection operator overhead is negligible compared to the cost of RBF evaluation itself.
